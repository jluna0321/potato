          <p>A plague on both your houses [Source: CHE]

As the contentious battle between analytic and continental philosophy approaches its 100th anniversary, Hans Johann-Glock examines both the history of the divide and the possibility of bridging the philosophical chasm. Mr. Johann-Glock, a reader in philosophy at the University of Reading and a fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, notes the difficulty of defining the two camps, but still attempts to do so. Continental, or Germanophone, philosophy -- predominant in Latin America and mainland Europe -- is championed by those who "purport to carry the torch of the great philosophy of the past." Its adherents examine such classic philosophical problems as the meaning of life. Analytic philosophy, which grew out of mathematical logic at the turn of the century, defied its predecessor by attacking traditional problems with an approach informed by that logic, as well as by the natural sciences. Still the dominant school among English-speaking philosophers, the analytic, or Anglophone, approach broke from its continental counterpart initially with its concentration on analysis. Today, Mr. Johann-Glock writes, the accusations by both sides are less vehement, their pronouncements less dogmatic, their boundaries less well-defined. Still, perhaps the best solution, he concludes, is to abandon efforts to synthesize the two, and simply "wish a plague" on them both. Their fundamental differences still, and may always, remain: Analytic philosophy remains "prone to scientism, the view that there is no knowledge outside natural science," Mr. Johann-Glock writes, while German philosophers "often present themselves as guardians of humanism."</p>
          <p> What science doesn't tell us about global warming. [Source: CHE] In the global-warming debate the logic behind
            public discourse and political action has been precisely backwards," write Daniel Sarewitz, a research scholar at 
            Columbia University's Center for Science, Policy and Outcomes, and Roger Pielke Jr., a scientist with the Environmental
            and Societal Impacts Group at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The two men trace, from the 1980's to 
            the present, the debate over global warming -- a debate that they write has focused disproportionately and misguidedly
            on science, discarding practical solutions to the problems of a changing climate. The authors write that the "defining
            event" of the debate came in June 1988, when James Hansen, a federal climate scientist, told Congress "with '99 percent 
            confidence' that 'the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now.'" Since then, the 
            international focus with regard to global warming has been an "obsession with carbon dioxide" and combating the
            greenhouse effect. While Mr. Sarewitz and Mr. Pielke are quick to note that research is a necessary component of 
            understanding global warming, they write that such a strong focus on research provides no viable ground for policymaking.
            More attention needs to be given to the economic and social circumstances that make events, like hurricanes and
            floods, so devastating to the human populations they affect, the authors write. When 10,000 Central Americans died 
            in 1998 because of Hurricane Mitch, the authors argue, it should not have been seen as a harbinger of climate-change 
            catastrophes, but as a contemporary example of how the climatic shift can affect "countries where dense and rapidly
            increasing populations live in environmentally degraded conditions." Write the authors, "[E]nvironmentalists and 
            scientists, in focusing their own, increasingly congruent interests on carbon-dioxide emissions, have framed the
            problem of global environmental protection in a way that can offer no realistic prospect of a solution." The article 
            is available online at http://www.theatlantic.com/cgi-bin/o/issues/2000/07/sarewitz.htm</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
